# Motivator
Interactively converses and motivates using some sentiment analysis

Scenario:

1. User starts the program and program asks following questions:

a) How is the day going so far? 
User enters some text. Based on the tone of the text, program chooses from various sentiment categories and reverts with next statement/question. 

Categories of sentiments:
Happy, Cheerful, Ecstatic, Merry, Joyful, Content...
Sad, Depressed, Grief, Worry, Negative attitude...
Fearful, Panic-state, Afraid, Frightened, Scared....
Angry, Curses Hurls, Raised voice/tone/text-based (!!!) etc....

For every category, have some motivating statements mapped to the keywords. 

Purpose of the application is to provide a virtual "friend" who has a listening ear and not passing any judgements. 

Benefits: 
1) Will help shift from negative to positive attitude and can get people to express more freely without word-shaming. 
2) Provide reporting capability on your behavioral/thinking traits and corrective measures so that time is not lost in thinking negative!
